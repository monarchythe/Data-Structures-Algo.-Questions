# Data-Structures-Algo.-Questions
This repository tracks my daily coding practice aimed at improving my skills in data structures and algorithms for coding interviews. I use Python for solving these questions, as it aligns with my role as a data engineer. 
I plan to tackle a daily coding question, documenting my journey here. Logging will be categorized into INITIAL SOLUTION, MY FINAL SOLUTION, and CORRECT SOLUTION.
